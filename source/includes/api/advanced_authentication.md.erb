## Bearer Token

Alternatively to using an API Key for authorization you may use an actual session by including a Bearer token, that you receive by login request, in your Authorizatoin header.

> To authorize, use this code:

```shell
# With shell, you can just pass the correct header with each request
curl -X GET https://api.mwwondemand.com/api/endpoint \
  -H "Content-Type: application/vnd.api+json" \
  -H "Accept: application/vnd.api+json; version=1" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR.API.TOKEN"
```

The API expects an Authorization header to be included in all API requests to the server in a header that looks like the following:

`Authorization: Bearer YOUR.API.TOKEN`

<aside class="notice">
You must replace <code>YOUR.API.TOKEN</code> with the token you receive in response to a login request.
