# Authentication

Customers are granted a API Key that can be used to authorize requests to the application server at <https://api.mwwondemand.com>

Alternatively a token can be used by making a login request.


## API Key

> To authorize, use this code:

```ruby
# TODO
```

```python
# TODO
```

```shell
# With shell, you can just pass the correct header with each request
curl -X GET https://api.mwwondemand.com/api/endpoint \
  -H "Content-Type: application/vnd.api+json" \
  -H "Accept: application/vnd.api+json; version=1" \
  -H "Authorization: auth-key=YOUR_API_KEY"
```

> Make sure to replace `YOUR_API_KEY` with your API key.

Access to the API uses an API key for authentication. You can register a new API key at <https://api.mwwondemand.com/account/>.

After you register, you can view your API key at <https://api.mwwondemand.com/account/user/api-key>.

The API expects an API key to be included in all API requests to the server in a header that looks like the following:

`Authorization: auth-key=YOUR_API_KEY`

<aside class="notice">
You must replace <code>YOUR_API_KEY</code> with your personal API key.
</aside>


## Regenerate Your API Key

> To expire your existing api-key and generate a new one, use this code:

```shell
curl -X PATCH https://api.mwwondemand.com/api/regenerate-api-key \
  -H "Content-Type: application/vnd.api+json" \
  -H "Accept: application/vnd.api+json; version=1" \
  -H "Authorization: auth-key=YOUR_EXISTING_API_KEY"
```

> Make sure to replace `YOUR_EXISTING_API_KEY` with your existing API key.
> The above command returns a response like:

```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Authorization: auth-key=YOUR_NEW_API_KEY
Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8
```

```json
{
  "data": {
    "id": "YOUR_USER_ID",
    "type": "users",
    "attributes": {
      "api-key": "YOUR_NEW_API_KEY"
    }
  }
}
```

To change your API key make a PATCH request using the `api/regenerate-api-key` endpoint.

- Requires your existing API Key in the `Authorization` Header
- Response Header and body include your newly generated `api-key`

Also, you can regenerate the key at <https://api.mwwondemand.com/account/user/api-key>.

## Bearer Token

Alternatively to using an API Key for authorization you may use an actual session by including a Bearer token, that you receive by login request, in your Authorizatoin header.

> To authorize, use this code:

```shell
# With shell, you can just pass the correct header with each request
curl -X GET https://api.mwwondemand.com/api/endpoint \
  -H "Content-Type: application/vnd.api+json" \
  -H "Accept: application/vnd.api+json; version=1" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR.API.TOKEN"
```

The API expects an Authorization header to be included in all API requests to the server in a header that looks like the following:

`Authorization: Bearer YOUR.API.TOKEN`

<aside class="notice">
You must replace <code>YOUR.API.TOKEN</code> with the token you receive in response to a login request.
</aside>


## Login

This endpoint is for login to receive a Bearer token.

<%= partial "includes/api/curl_snippets/post_login_request.md" %>

> The above command returns JSON structured like this:

<%= partial "includes/api/json_snippets/post_login_response.md" %>

`POST https://api.mwwondemand.com/api/login` using `Content-Type: application/json`

With JSON bodyâ€¦

`{"api_user":{"email":"user@domain.com","password":"Xa34.678"}}`

### POST Parameters

Parameter | Default / Type | Description
--------- | ------- | -----------
api_user | {} | The scope for the session request.
email | string | Your username is your email.
password | string | Your customer dashboard password.

You can use the login endpoint to refresh your Bearer token as well

`POST https://api.mwwondemand.com/api/login` with `Authorization: Bearer YOUR.API.TOKEN` header and no JSON body.

This will return a new Bearer token, your current token will become invalid.

Alternatively, you can login with your API KEY.

`POST https://api.mwwondemand.com/api/login` with `Authorization: auth-key=YOUR_API_KEY` header and no JSON body.
